## Setting up *ZSH* as our shell

Manjaro already comes with *ZSH* installed, but isn't the shell by default. The snippet below will set *ZSH* as the default shell for the current user and will download some nice plugins that will provide autocompletions, suggestions and syntax high-lighting

```bash
chsh $(whoami) -s $(which zsh)

mkdir ~/.zsh

git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-completions.git ~/.zsh/zsh-completions
git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions ~/.zsh/zsh-autosuggestions
git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting.git ~/.zsh/zsh-syntax-highlighting

exec zsh
```

Now is time to configure a critical thing. All the aliases that I like for the shortcuts, the shell prompt... on *ZSH*. The best way to do it, without cloning my personal dotfiles w'd be just to get the following file. But first let's backup the `Manjaro` default *ZSH* prompt configuration.

```bash
mv ~/.zshrc ~/.zshrc-manjaro
```

Now let's gonna get my classical *ZSH* configuration:

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheRustifyer/dotfiles/refs/heads/main/.zshrc
```

And again, refresh the *ZSH* shell session:

```bash
exec zsh
```
## Modern terminal tools

The snippet below will provide you with a good set of niceties that will make your shell sessions much more pleasant. Most of them are rewrites of classical `Unix-GNU` tools for other ones rewritten in `Rust`.  They're picked because they're extremely fast, have a better syntax than the legacy ones, provides colourful icons/text, which makes things looks better in the eye...

```bash
cargo install --locked starship

local terminal_tools=("bat" "lsd" "zoxide" "du-dust" "ripgrep" "fd-find" "sd" "procs" "bottom" "topgrade" "broot" "tokei")

for package in "${terminal_tools[@]}"; do
	cargo install $package
done
```

## Upgrading the shell prompt

Now it's time to get our shell a modern, fast good looking theme. The responsible will be `Starship` which is a shell prompt written in `Rust`. Copy the following content into:

```bash
nvim ~/.config/starship.toml
```

```toml
# A continuation prompt that displays two filled in arrows
continuation_prompt = '▶▶ '

# Use custom format
format = '''[┌─>](bold green) $os $all'''
# [│](bold green)$os $username at $directory$git_branch$git_commit$all

# What I like to see on the right of the prompt
# format = """$os $username at $directory$git_branch$git_commit$all"""
