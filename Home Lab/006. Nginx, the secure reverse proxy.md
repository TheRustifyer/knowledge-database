## Install Nginx

There's no much explanation here. The easiest way is just to go to the system's install script on `~`, and execute the script.

```bash
. ~/install.sh -ng
```

This will install `Nginx` in your machine with the *up-to-date* virtual hosts configured and stored in the git bare repository.
