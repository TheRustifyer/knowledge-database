Everything is handled from within the `docker-compose.yaml` file under `~/.hosted/arr/`.

But the setup itself is kinda messy. And then there's other interesting configurations for everything to be configured in a nice and neat way, and make it work with other tools, like the `Jellyfin` integration with our `LLDAP`.

# Jellyfin

# OIDC integration for SSO

## LLDAP Integration

Since Jellyfin is running inside the `gluetun` container's network namespace, it perceives the network from the perspective of the `gluetun` container. To allow Jellyfin to communicate with LLDAP on the host, you can use the special Docker DNS name `host.docker.internal`, which resolves to the host's IP address. However, this name is primarily supported on Docker for Windows and Mac. On Linux, you might need to determine the host's IP address from within the container.â€‹

To find the host's IP address from within the `gluetun` container:

```bash
docker exec -it gluetun sh
ip route | awk '/default/ { print $3 }'
```

And then we just input that returned *ip adreess* in the `ip`box of the web form for the ldap connection.
