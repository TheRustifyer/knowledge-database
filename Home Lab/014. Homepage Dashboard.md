Homepage is a stylish dashboard that you can use to display all your local applications in one central location.

This dashboard boasts a huge number of integrations, allowing you to display additional information from your Docker container or even software like Plex.

While easy to set up, this software is one of the trickier dashboards to configure. It does not feature web-based settings like Heimdall or Homarr and is entirely text-based.

However, once you learn how to write valid YAML and understand how to configure Homepage, you will find this process quite simple. It is intimidating when you first utilize the software.

Best of all, Homepage is super lightweight, making it an excellent choice for maximizing the resources of your self-hosted system.

## Installation

```bash
docker-compose -f ~/.hosted/homepage/docker-compose.yaml up -d
```
