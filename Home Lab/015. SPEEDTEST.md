This tutorial is great if you’re interested in monitoring how your download speed, upload speed, and ping are affected over time.

Additionally, this can help you work out what times your network may be at its peak capacity or if you’re suffering from a degraded internet connection.

To achieve this internet speed monitor, we will be showing you how to write a small Python script that interacts with a program called Speedtest CLI from Ookla.

Speedtest CLI is what our internet speed monitor will use to monitor the internet connection.

This program works by polling the popular [speedtest.net](https://speedtest.net) service to get your ping, download speed, and upload speed.

If you would prefer to have a more full featured speed test tracker, we recommend [following our speedtest Docker guide instead](https://pimylifeup.com/docker-internet-speedtest-tracker/). This will give you a fancy web interface you can use to view your results and still allow integration with InfluxDB.

## Installation

```bash
docker-compose -f ~/.hosted/management/speedtest/docker-compose.yaml up -d
```
