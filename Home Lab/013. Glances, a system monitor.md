A system monitor allows you to track the current status of your hardware by giving you an overview of information such as CPU and memory usage.

To set up a system monitor on the Raspberry Pi, we will use a piece of software called [Glances](https://github.com/nicolargo/glances). Glances is a self-hosted monitoring tool that gives you all the information you need to know about your system at a glance.

For example, this tool will tell you about your CPU and memory usage and show you the current temperature of your system. It will also list the applications using your resources and give you network information.

The Glances system monitor presents all this information within an easy-to-access web interface. You donâ€™t even need a screen attached to your system to view the status of your system.

Best of all, Glances is easy to set up on the Raspberry Pi, so you will be able to monitor your system in a few short steps. Please note for this tutorial to work, you **must be running a 64-bit operating system**.

## Installation

```bash
docker-compose -f ~/.hosted/management/glances/docker-compose.yaml up -d
```
