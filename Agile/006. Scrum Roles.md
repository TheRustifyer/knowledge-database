## The Product Owner

The **Product Owner** is the role of one person, and they're responsible for maximizing the value of the product.

They do this by clearly understanding the future state or the vision the organization has as well as the needs of its users and customers.

And then they articulate that or communicate that to the development team.

Ultimately, the product owner is the one who makes the product decisions.
They determine which features and characteristics are implemented and in which order.
It's their responsibility to ensure the decisions that they're making assist in generating value
to the customers and stakeholders.

## The Development Team

The development team is a group of cross-functional people who execute upon or create the features and characteristics that were identified.

And they do this through continuously collaborating with the product owner to gain clarity and understanding of the customer need.

Ultimately, it is the development team that creates the solution increments that satisfy the customer need, thus creating the value.

Now, the development team is made up of professionals with different backgrounds and titles.
Depending on your product or your solution, this could include business analyst, software developers, business intelligence analysts, architects, subject matter experts, et cetera.

Really, any title is fair game as long as they bring value to the team.

And before we move on, one other unique and powerful thing about the development team is they're not overseen by anyone.

They don't have a manager dictating tasks or supervising their work.
The development team members are instead accountable to the team as a whole.
They work together, they collaborate, and throughout each iteration, to deliver as much value as they can. And after each iteration, they acknowledge and learn from their mistakes, allowing them to adapt and get better.

## The Scrum Master

The master of Scrum.

Because they're the Scrum expert, they understand the theory, the practices, rules, and values of the Scrum framework, and it's the Scrum Master's responsibility to ensure the product owner
and the development team do as well.

The Scrum Master is often referred to as the servant leader because they're enabling the development team to create maximum value by removing their impediments or the roadblocks to their progress.

Maybe the team is unable to identify someone to answer a specific question.
So they're unable to move forward on a feature.
Instead of the development team spending time on trying to find that person, the *Scrum Master* could do it.

This allows the team then to continue to create other functionality in the meantime, maximizing the value, the development team and the Scrum team as a whole, is able to create.

## Summary ðŸ“‘

So it is these three roles, the product owner, the development team, and the Scrum Master, that work together to make up a Scrum team, which delivers value to the organization, its users, and its customers.

### As Scrum Master

My day started out by, you know, being in the daily standup and that's a 15 minutes meeting again like we talked in the lecture, you know.

I go around and I say, "Okay, let's just go around and answer the three question:" 

- What did you do yesterday?
- What are you gonna focus on today?
- And do you have impediments?

And we go around and I'm actually focused on hearing however we is doing, and if there's an impediment, I'm actually making a list of impediments so that I can make it visible or I can work with a team member to go out there and resolve their impediment.

I've also been in an environment where people didn't want to answer those three questions.
So one of the things that I did is I did something called ***appreciative inquiry***.

So the question, instead of asking *"What did you do yesterday?"* What we said is, *"What are you gonna focus on today? Are we in track to meet our sprint goal? And do you have any impediments?"*

So that's a little bit more indirect and people felt and resonated with this question. So you can run your daily standard that way too.
