![[scrum-team.png]] Let's look at the Scrum values.

These values are very powerful and effective because **Scrum** is leveraged by a team and these values really support team members when they are working to solve ***complex problems***.

# Openness

![[scrum-openness.png]]

**Openness** just means that team members are open to living the Scrum values over just doing Scrum.

Team members are open to uncover and find effective ways of solving problems.

Whenever team members are solving on our tough problems, openness can mean that they are open to inspecting and adapting and figuring out better ways to solve that problem as a team.

So:
- Being open to other people's ideas
- Being open to change in general

## Commitment

Whenever people are looking at this value people immediately think about **commitment** to doing the work or executing on the sprint goal or the work that team has committed to.

But it's actually more than that. This means that team members are committed to each other in terms of doing their best and coming up with solutions collaboratively.

This actually also means commitment to not only just delivering software but delivering software to solve end users or customers problems.

**Commitment** also means that team members are going to give their best action and effort to solve a problem versus just focusing on a sprint goal.

## Focus

If you are trying to solve any kind of problem, human beings needs to be able to focus.

**Scrum** recommends that team members plan on a certain amount of work and they focus on that for a certain period of time.
And the whole goal of the team is to get this work that they picked to done.

Focus can also mean that team members are focusedon solving a problem that they have decided as a team to do versus thinking about every shiny thing that's out there and trying to build everything.

Focus can also mean that team members are focused on customer happiness and delivering value to the stakeholders.

## Courage

Mark Twain said: - *"Courage is not the absence of fear, it is acting in spite of it."*

Courage in this context means that team members show up with courage when they're working on tough problems and they're not afraid to try and come up with their bold ideas.

Change is usually hard and we are not perfect. However, this Scrum value encourages team members to do their best despite of not being perfect and despite of change being hard.

## Respect

And then the last value of **Scrum** is respect.

Whenever we are working on difficult problems and we are working as a team and we share our success and failures together, we will be professional and we'll respect the team members culture, their background, their ways of working and we will also respect their opinion.

## Summary ðŸ“‘

Those are the five strong values and if team members focus on embracing these strong values
on a day-to-day basis, it is much effective for teams to acquire the ***agile mindset***.
