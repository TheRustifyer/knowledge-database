# Gamma Categorization

Before diving into the design patterns themselves, there is one more housekeeping topic: the Gamma Categorization.

> [!info]
> This categorization is named after Erich Gamma, one of the authors of the original Gang of Four (GoF) book, which used C++ and Smalltalk to illustrate design patterns.

## The Three Main Categories of Design Patterns

Design patterns, regardless of the language or source, are typically divided into three main categories:

### Creational Patterns

These patterns deal with object creation or construction.
While creating an object may seem as simple as calling a constructor, in reality, it can be more complex.

Object creation can be explicit, where you call a constructor directly, or implicit, where frameworks (e.g., dependency injection or reflection) handle instantiation behind the scenes.

Initialization may be:
	•	Wholesale: a single constructor call is sufficient.
	•	Piecewise (step-by-step): the object requires multiple steps before it’s fully initialized and ready for use.

### Structural Patterns

These patterns focus on the organization and structure of classes and their members.

They emphasize interface adherence and often involve creating wrappers that mimic or adapt underlying classes.

==Structural patterns== highlight good API design, aiming to make classes and interfaces convenient and intuitive to use.

Examples often demonstrate how to wrap or compose objects to provide enhanced or modified behavior while preserving the original interface.

### Behavioral Patterns

Unlike creational and structural categories, behavioral patterns do not follow a single common theme. They each solve different problems related to communication, assignment of responsibilities, and object interaction.

Some overlap exists (e.g., Strategy and Template Method both encapsulate algorithms but use different techniques).

Behavioral patterns are unique in their purpose and solution approach, addressing specific design challenges related to behavior.

# Conclusion

These categorizations help organize design patterns and provide a useful framework for studying and applying them effectively.
