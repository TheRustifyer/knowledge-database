> The Single Responsibility Principle states that a class should have one, and only one, reason to change.

In other words, a class should have a single primary responsibility and should not take on additional unrelated responsibilities.

## Real-World Example

Imagine you are a programmer, and your primary responsibility is to write code.
If someone asks you to make coffee, that task is outside your primary responsibility—it should be handled by someone else or yourself using a coffee machine.

### Practical Example: The Journal Class

Suppose you want to create a Journal class that stores your personal journal entries:
	•	The journal has a title.
	•	It contains a collection of entries, stored in a vector of strings.
	•	You add a constructor to initialize the title.
	•	You add a method `add_entry` that accepts a string and appends it to the entries.
	•	To keep entries informative, you prepend a counter number to each entry.

Example usage:

```cpp
Journal journal{"Dear Diary"};
journal.add_entry("I ate a bug");
journal.add_entry("I cried today");
```

Here, the Journal class is responsible only for managing its entries and title.

### Avoiding Mixing Concerns: Persistence

What if you want to save the journal to a file?

It might be tempting to add `save` and `load` methods directly to the Journal class, like:

```cpp
void save(const std::string &filename)
void load(const std::string &filename)
```

This approach mixes persistence concerns with journal management, violating the [[1. Single Responsibility Principle| Single Responsability Principle]].

If you do this for multiple classes (e.g., many domain objects), managing persistence scattered everywhere becomes a maintenance nightmare.

### Separation of Concerns

The better approach is to separate persistence from the Journal class by creating a dedicated persistence manager.

For example, a `PersistenceManager` class can provide:

```cpp
static void save(const Journal &journal, const std::string &filename);
```

This class handles saving and loading all kinds of objects centrally.
When you want to change how you save data (e.g., switch from file system to database), you modify only the persistence manager, not all your domain classes.

The Journal handles what it’s supposed to: managing journal entries and title.

The persistence-related functionality belongs to a separate component, making the system more robust and adaptable.
## Summary

The Single Responsibility Principle encourages:
	•	Narrow and focused classes.
	•	Separation of concerns.
	•	More maintainable and extensible code.
